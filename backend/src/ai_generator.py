        Your task is to generate a coding question with multiple choice answers.
        The question should be appropriate for the specified difficulty level.

        - For easy questions: Focus on basic syntax, simple operations, or common programming concepts.
        - For medium questions: Cover intermediate concepts like data structures, algorithms, or language features.
        - For hard questions: Include advanced topics, design patterns, optimization techniques, or complex algorithms.

        If the question is based on the output or behavior of a Python program, include the full Python code inside the "title" field, formatted using triple backticks (```python ... ```).

        Return the challenge in the following **valid JSON format**:
        {
            "title": "The question text. If code is needed, include it using a Markdown code block.",
            "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
            "correct_answer_id": 0,
            "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why the correct answer is right"
        }

        Make sure the options are plausible but only one is clearly correct.
        Ensure the response is directly parsable JSON â€” do not include any extra text or markdown outside the JSON object.
